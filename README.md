# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

A machine learning project predicting next-day's rainfall in Australia using 10 years of meteorological data. Demonstrates ML pipeline architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization.

## Project Highlights
**Binary Classification**: Predict Yes/No rainfall for next day  
**Dataset**: xxx weather records across Australian locations (2008-2017)  
**Approach**: Scikit-learn Pipeline + GridSearchCV for model optimization  
**Models Tested**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
**Best Performance**: xx% accuracy with optimized Random Forest and xx% accuracy with xxx

## Key Features
- 22 weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, etc.)
- Feature engineering: categorical encoding, numerical scaling (??)
- Cross-validation: Stratified K-Fold for balanced evaluation (??)
- Comprehensive evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/)
- Original: Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology
- Time period: 2008-2017

## Results
- Best Model: Random Forest (xx estimators, max_depth=xx)
- Accuracy: xx%
- See [RESULTS.md](./RESULTS.md) for detailed metrics
